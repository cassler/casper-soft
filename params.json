The post title is presented subtlely and the full content of the post is displayed rather than an excerpt. It is recommended that you keep the content of these posts exclusively to unordered lists. A featured image is not displayed on the index but is available on individual archive pages. \r\n\r\n### Sexy Featured Images\r\nWork in Progress\r\n\r\n### Bigfoot.JS Footnotes\r\nThe default footnote format is augmented and styled using BigFootJs. Rather than a superscript number you'll see a nice inline symbol which displays your footnote/sidenote inlined. If javascript is disabled, everything works as usual.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n[Casper Soft](https://github.com/cassler/casper-soft/) is built and maintained by @cassler for [http://darin.co].
